  "history": {
    "title": "History of the Village of Bailovo",
    "content": "The village of Bailovo, birthplace of the classic Bulgarian writer Elin Pelin, is located east of the municipal center Gorna Malina and 43 km east of Sofia. It is situated in the western forested branches of the Ihtiman section of Sredna Gora mountain. The writer wrote: 'My native village lies directly facing the sun in a beautiful place, where Sredna Gora separates from its mother, the Balkan Mountain, and heads eastward…'",
    "content2": "Bailovo has existed since the 12th century. Initially, it was settled a little to the south, about 500–600 meters west of today's village, in the river valley around the chapel 'St. Trinity.' The hill that is believed to have been the village center is called 'The Monastery,' and according to old legends, the monastery of 'St. George' was located there. It lasted until 1792, until the uprising against the Turks led by Bulgarian Muslims Mehmed Sinab and Dertli Mehmed.",
    "content3": "The greatest contribution to the study of the history of Bailovo was made by Doctor of Archaeological Sciences, Elin Pelin's cousin – Ivan Velkov. According to Velkov's long-term research, the area called 'Andreshko's Swamp' by the locals was scattered with many small mounds — an indication of a large necropolis. The clay vessels, bronze and iron artifacts found in them confirm that the necropolis can be dated to the early 4th century BC, the so-called 'Second Iron Age.'",
    "content4": "About 3 km east of Bailovo lies the area 'Klenov Dol,' where fragments of clay vessels and coins from the later Roman period are often found, confirming the existence of an ancient settlement there.",
    "content5": "Information about Bailovo from more recent times can be found in the firman of Sultan Ahmed Khan III from 1721. In the lists of villages assigned with the duty of 'dervendji' (road guardians), Bailovo is mentioned as being responsible for providing guards for the detachment of Buluk Bashi Nedyalko from Sofia.",
    "content6": "Today's Bailovo was settled around 1815. Its beginnings were laid by Elin Pelin's great-grandfather – Kara Stanyo Ivanov from the Bolchova neighborhood of the village of Poibrene, in the Panagyurishte region. At first, he came to these places to hide his sheep from the Turkish tax collectors. He initially founded a settlement in the area 'Klenov Dol,' but later moved to the current location because it was warmer, more secluded, and had good pastures and abundant water. There is also a large, vigorous spring here that gives rise to the Bailovo River, at the lower end of which there were four watermills.",
    "content7": "The number of residents with permanent address registration is 240, and those with current address registration is 411 (according to GRAO as of 02.02.2023). More than 140 people live in the village without registered address.",
    "content8": "Bailovo primarily engages in crop farming, while livestock farming has declined. Bailovo is a green, clean, and tidy village. Its natural features make it an attractive place for relaxation and tourism.",

      "detailed_history_title": "Detailed History",
      "detailed_history": "It was built by master builder Gancho Trifonov from Smolsko village in 1884. The hewn stones, placed around the doors and windows and at the corners of the building, were brought from Sarantsi village, located more than 10 km away. The church is single-nave with an altar, a common area, and a women's gallery built in its western part. Its ceiling was painted by Dimitar Petrov Bozhanchev, born on February 16, 1897 in Sarantsi village, Sofia region. He completed higher education at the pedagogical institute in Shumen, after which he taught in the villages of Negushevo, Osositsa and Sarantsi. He mainly taught drawing and singing, composed and conducted three-voice choirs, and collected folk songs. He spent most of his working time painting. He also had a hobby - repairing watches. Dimitar Bozhanchev died in his native village in 1964. The small-sized icons are the work of the famous iconographer of his time, Yoto (Ivan) Nedelkov Yonchov from Makotsevo village, called Yoto the Icon Painter for short. He worked on the icons for a long time and with concentration, and when they were completely finished, he personally carried them to Bailovo. Yoto the Icon Painter was born in 1840. From a young age, he showed great talent and inclination toward drawing. In 1861, he met the famous Mirkovo painter David Georgiev, learned the secrets of this art from him, and in a few years progressed so much that he surpassed his teacher. Yoto the Icon Painter was not only very talented but also a very hardworking artist. He painted the frescoes and icons in the churches in Zhelyava, Bailovo, Sarantsi, Dolno Kamartsi, Aprilovo, the \"St. Elijah\" monastery near Belopoptsi village, Lesnovo, Grigorevo, Yana, in some Pirdop villages, in the church in Pirdop town and elsewhere. He also engaged in wood carving, carving the doors in the churches in the villages of Makotsevo, Bailovo and Osositsa. Elin Pelin, who was his relative, had wanted to study with Yoto the Icon Painter. This is what the writer remembers: \"As a child, I loved to draw with special passion. The drawings and pictures I found in various books, I drew and copied with special passion. Everyone said I would become an artist. They talked about sending me to a distant relative of mine, who at that time had gained fame as a great church icon painter. They called him Yoto the Painter. My parents wanted to leave me with him to work. But, of course, I could not become a painter...\" Yoto the Icon Painter died in Makotsevo village in 1908. The church is surrounded by a stone wall, its bell has a melodious voice and was cast on site from copper vessels, silver bracelets and other jewelry collected from the population. It houses the village's treasury, which is a painted wooden box with an inscription: \"Common treasury, in which everyone according to their dignity should give as much as they love for maintaining the expenses for the church or for the school in our village with the permission and support of Mr. Stamen Bozhichkov, and belongs to Bailovo village. 1873, January 4th day. p. Y o. N.\" The church is declared a cultural monument. Archpriest Serafim Yanev spiritually cares for the village parish, and Radostin and Tsvetanka Malamovi care for and maintain it. In the small house located in the yard lived Grandpa Dobri. With the funds donated by him, repairs were made to the church."
